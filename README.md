# identpp

C++ implementation of [ident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ident_protocol) protocol.

---

To use it in most sceranios. You need to use port 113 on TCP. 

Otherwise if you are just testing or have the option to change the port the server uses for [ident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ident_protocol), you can change it.

Also to customize you need to modify variables in the code and compile.

I'm hoping to fix this in the future, and have pre-built binaries too.
